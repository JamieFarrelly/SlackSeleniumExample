Slack Selenium Example
==============================

Example of how to use Selenium to automate web browser interactions - this project is part of the tutorial that I [wrote for Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/developer-how-to/how-to-use-Selenium-to-automate-browser-interactions). It'll allow you to log in to Slack, click on a Slack channel and then send a message to that channel. As part of the tutorial, I've left a TODO as a challenge!
